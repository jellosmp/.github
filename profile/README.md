## Welcome :wave:

Jello SMP is currently a **Whitelist Only** Minecraft Java 1.19.2 server running on PaperMC.

While the server is whitelist only, the plugins are open-source and this organization catalogs all of them.
> Please note this organization is not comprehensive and there are some off the shelf plugins being used.

## Server Info

**RAM:** ``5 GB`` |
**Slots:** ``100`` | **Version:** ``1.19.2 Java`` | **API:** ``Paper``

> Please note while the server using Paper to avoid dupe glitches and for performance, Bukkit & Spigot's API is far superior imo and is what my plugins will use
